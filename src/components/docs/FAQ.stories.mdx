# FAQ

**After building**

1. *I tried opening my index.html in browser and all I see is a white page*

If you want to directly access your webapp you need to check the following steps (one at a time or both): 

- Open your browser console and check for 404 errors. If there are any proceed to change your VUE_APP_BUILD_PATH accordingly. (build and check fi the problem is solved)
- Open this file <code>< YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATIOn >/src/router/index.js</code> in your favorite editor and replace <code>createWebHistory</code> with <code>createWebHashHistory</code>  (build and check fi the problem is solved)

<br/>

2. *I have lots of 404 logs in my console.*

In your .env file change VUE_APP_BUILD_PATH value to your app location.

Example: <code>example.com/my/app/location => VUE_APP_BUILD_PATH=/my/app/location </code>
