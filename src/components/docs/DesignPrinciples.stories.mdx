# Design Principles

We use atomic design concept for grouping components (without templates and pages).

Atomic design

In general, there are three groups of components:

**Atoms** - Atoms are the most basic and abstract components for building other components, such as logos, button, input, etc. <br/>
**Molecules** - Molecules are components built from groups of atoms bonded together, take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of the design systems. Some good examples are a navigation, cards, forms, etc. <br/>
**Organisms** - Organisms are complex and distinct components built from groups of molecules joined together, such as header, layouts, sections, etc.
